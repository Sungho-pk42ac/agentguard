# Examples

This directory contains intentionally fake sample inputs. They are designed to demonstrate AgentGuard behavior without including real credentials or private data.

## Risky MCP config

```bash
agentguard scan-mcp < examples/risky-mcp.json
```

Expected result: `BLOCK` or `REVIEW` findings for broad filesystem access, writable roots, and credential-like environment passthrough.

## Risky PR diff

```bash
agentguard scan-diff < examples/risky-pr.diff
```

Expected result: findings for newly added secret-like or risky shell material.

## Agent transcript

```bash
agentguard scan-log --policy examples/agent-policy.yaml < examples/agent-transcript.log
```

Expected result: findings for operations that should require review under the sample policy.

## Markdown report

```bash
agentguard scan-diff --out agent-risk-report.md < examples/risky-pr.diff
```

A sample report is stored at [`examples/expected-report.md`](../examples/expected-report.md).

## SARIF

```bash
agentguard scan-diff --sarif --out agentguard.sarif < examples/risky-pr.diff
```

A sample SARIF payload is stored at [`examples/agentguard.sarif`](../examples/agentguard.sarif).
